# OpenLeaf

The goal of this project is to identify opportunities for utilizing natural language processing and information retrieval methods to improve knowledge sharing activities among teams.

I am mining and analyzing Wikipedia discussions and edit histories to understand how communities organize when producing documentation. In particular, I am interested if ideas tend to merge or if one editor dominates a specific section. This would have implications for the usefulness of sharing views on the same idea.

I am also interested in detecting issues like biased sentences by constructing an information retrieval framework based on past sentences flagged with bias. This could have a wide scale impact for any organization attempting to produce good documentation.
