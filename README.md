# OpenLeaf

I am mining and analyzing Wikipedia discussions and edit histories to understand how communities self-organize when developing documentation.

The goal of this project is to identify opportunities for utilizing natural language processing and information retrieval methods to improve knowledge sharing activities among teams.

I am also interested in detecting biased sentences by constructing an information retrieval framework based on past sentences flagged with bias.
