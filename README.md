# OpenTree

In hopes to one day automate knowledge sharing, I plan to mine Wikipedia discussions and edit histories to understand how people work together when writing a Wiki. 

I am interested in:

- Does a single editor dominates a specific subsection or do most editors split their edits across sections?
- When / at what point ideas tend to need merging by a single editor
- What techniques people use to merge ideas and how similar the before and after of the article is
- What type of actions lead to refinements? Can we automatically guide a reviewer for good places to refine?

I am also interested in detecting issues like change in tone and biased sentences.
