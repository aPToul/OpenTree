# OpenLeaf

I plan to mine Wikipedia discussions and edit histories to understand how people work when producing documentation. 

I am interested when and how ideas tend to be merged and be refined.
I wonder if a single editor dominates a specific subsection or if most editors split their edits across sections.

I am also interested in detecting issues like change in tone and biased sentences.
